a) Added flavicon twitter bird to show at the top in the browswer and for favorites.
   I read how to do this by going through the MDN Mozilla Web Docs HTML tutorials.

b) Added Twitter's Navigation menu at the top (Home, Moments, etc.).
   I managed to get this Navigation menu centered and aligned properyly
   by adding align-items: center; and display: flex; under the #header in
   the .css file. I played around with the options using the chrome
   inspecter learned in class.

c) Enhanced the Profile Info section by adding a big Follow button and
   clickable photos, similar to real twitter.
   I played around with the chrome inspector to get the proper width and
   margins so that all the photos would fit in a 2 x 3 grid. For the
   follow button, I added font-size: 150%; border-radius: 50mm; to get
   larger font and added boarder-radius to get the curved look of the
   follow button similar to the real twitter button's. To make the six
   photos clickable, I just wrapped them in the anchor <a> leanred in class.
   I also had to add position: relative; in my custom #squarePhotos in
   the .css file.

d) Added shadowing to the box elements (Profile, Timeline)
   For this I added box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px grey; to the css elements
   #profileInfo and #timeline.

e) Added two additional Tweets
   I followed the same pattern give in the first two tweets.

f) Added an <iframe> elements to include a playable youtube video
   I leanred about the <iframe> element by reading the MDN Web Docs
   HTML tutorial, which is how you can link youtube videos and it uses
   YouTubes bandwidth when you play the video, not your websites.

g) Added the trending news section seen on the real Twitter page to float: left
   I took a screen shot of the live twitter news feed from my account
   and added this by creating a new <div> element in the HTML file and
   a new #trending box in the .css file where I played around with those
   settings from the chrome inspector.
